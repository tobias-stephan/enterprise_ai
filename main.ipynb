    "In this assignment, we develop a algorithm to predict an appendicitis diagnosis. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- The starting point of our project is exploratory_data_analysis notebook, in which we identify the most important points in the data and draw conclusions for the pipeline structure.  <br>\n",
    "- This structure consists of 1. feature_engineering_pipeline, 2. training_pipeline, 3. inference_pipeline and is subdivided into the respective steps that are noted in the individual pipelines. <br>\n",
    "- We start with feature_engineering, in which we first load our data set (loading_data) and clean it up (data_cleaning).  <br>\n",
    "- Based on this, in split_data the data set is split into train, test and validation data. <br>\n",
    "- After that the measures for encoding, scaling and imputing the categorical and numerical data are defined in the create_preprocessing_pipeline. <br>\n",
    "- In feature_preprocessor we transform the defined features. <br>\n",
    "- In the last part of the feature engineering (label_encoding), label encoding of the target variable is applied. <br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- The next part of our model is the training part.  <br> \n",
    "- In the step hp_tuning we perform hyperparameter tuning for either Random Forest or Decision Tree models using Optuna to maximize the F1 score. <br>\n",
    "- The steps model_trainer_decision_tree and model_trainer_random_forest each train the models. <br>\n",
    "- Next we evaluate the model in evaluate_model, which sets the foundation for the choice of the model. <br>\n",
    " <br>\n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "- Lastly there is the inference part where the model gets trained to make predictions on unseen data.  <br>\n",
    "- The first step at this stage is the inference_data_loader where we load the data and drop the columns which we analyzed before as not significant for out prediction.  <br>\n",
    "- The following inference_preprocessing transforms the inference data to prepare the inference prediction.  <br>\n",
    "- In predictor the actual prediction takes place.  <br>\n",
    "- In the end the prediction_loader loads the methods to predict.  <br>"
